\usage{
bwg_auth()
}
\value{
This function does not return a value but sets the `credentials$token` 
  environment variable with the obtained login token.
}
\description{
This function retrieves a login token necessary for accessing the BWG database. 
It prompts the user for their BWG username and password (the password is masked), 
and then sends a login request to the API to obtain an authentication token. 
This token is saved in the global environment variable `credentials` for later use.
}
\details{
The login information is stored in the `credentials` environment, specifically 
in the `token` field. The token is required for making subsequent requests 
to the BWG database API.
}
